# TestFairy no-op iOS SDK

This is a no-op version of the TestFairy iOS SDK

The purpose of a such a repo is to provide stubs for the entire TestFairy framework. If you are using TestFairy SDK only during
the development process, but wish to have it completely out when releasing to production -- then this is the repo for you.

Please review the documentation at https://docs.testfairy.com/FAQ/How_to_disable_TestFairy_in_production.html
